- [x] The dashboard will provide valuable insights and information about the data in the Phonepe pulse Github repository, making it a valuable tool for data analysis and decision-making.
      
- [x] This project will be a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for extracting, transforming, and visualizing data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository.

## Tools and Libraries Required :


| Tool/Lib | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Python | Using scripting language such as Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data. This may include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization. |
| PostgresSQL | Use the "Psycopg2" library in Python to connect to a PostgresSQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL commands |
| Streamlit and Plotly | Using the Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Plotly's built-in geo map functions can be used to display the data on a map and Streamlit can be used to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display. |
